Instead of calculating the digits from left to right and multiplying them alternatively by 1 and 3, did them backwards and multiply them by 3 and 1.

Simple error catching for cases when the digit length is less than 12 for above logic to be robust

* **ISBN_checksum_calculator.rb** - main code
* **test_case_generator.rb** - generates 12 digit numbers and calculates the checksum using `ISBNCheckSum#calculate`
* **testcases.txt** - result from `test_case_generator.rb`
